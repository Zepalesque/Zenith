### Zenith, a minecraft modding library

<br> 

Todo: a ton

<br>

**Planned features:**

- System for easy condition-based datapack logic (such as only enabling a certain worldgen feature with a specified config, or disabling recipes for a certain item when a specified mod is installed)
- System for custom synchronized block tints based on the biome (if necessary, DataMaps may be enough to do this sort of thing without any extra abstraction really necessary)
- System for creating all blocks for things such as wood types or stone types at a time, along with mostly-automatic data generation for them as well
- System for recipes that use itsm stacking mechanics, similar to how bundles work (for a specific example, see Ambrosium Shard infusion recipes in the Aether: Redux)
- A variety of other things I can see myself reusing for mods other than the Aether: Redux
