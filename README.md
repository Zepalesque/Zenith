TODO: well, everything tbh

<br>

**Planned features:**

---

- A config system to create jsons that load much earlier during the loading process than NeoForge's base config (probably, unless they changed this since the Forge split, I may also look for a seperate library so I don't have to do this all manually :joy:)
- System for easy condition-based datapack logic (such as only enabling a certain worldgen feature with a specified config, or disabling recipes for a certain item when a specified mod is installed)
- System for custom synchronized block tints based on the biome
- System for creating all blocks for things such as wood types or stone types at a time, along with mostly-automatic data generation for them as well
- A variety of other things I can see myself reusing for mods other than the Aether: Redux
