**Planned features:**

---

- System for easy condition-based datapack logic (such as only enabling a certain worldgen feature with a specified config, or disabling recipes for a certain item when a specified mod is installed)
- System for custom synchronized block tints based on the biome
- System for creating all blocks for things such as wood types or stone types at a time, along with mostly-automatic data generation for them as well
- System for recipes that use itsm stacking mechanics, similar to how bundles work (for a specific example, see Ambrosium Shard infusion recipes in the Aether: Redux)
- A variety of other things I can see myself reusing for mods other than the Aether: Redux
